I am currently a researcher at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab (Hong Kong).
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Computer Science and Engineering department of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Professor [Lei Chen](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~leichen/). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Beihang University (BUAA).
